SYNOPSIS
	python3 olympics.py [-ahnm] <term>

DESCRIPTION
olympics.py is a tool to search olympic medal results, and NOC member data, and NOC ranking data. The search type depends on the first tag before the search term. You can search for an athlete's name and be given their events and the medals they've earned, the members of an NOC using an NOC abreviation, or see the rankings of gold medals won by NOCs.

With no tag, olympics.py will search for athletes' medals with the provided search term. Given no search term in an athlete search or NOC search, the usage documentation will print.

If the noc tag is missing a search term, the usage documentation will show. If the medal_rankings tag recieves a search term, it will ignore it.

	-a, --athletes_medals	search for a list of the athletes yeilded by the search term and their medals listed by year, name, and then event.
	-n, --noc			given an NOC abbrievation or ID number, list the names of all the athletes in that NOC alphabetically
	-m, --medal_rankings	rank the NOCs and the number of gold medals each have in descending order

	-h, --help			provides the user with the usage documentation
