DESCRIPTION
For a term, books.py will search either books or authors for those that contain the given term. The search type depends on the first tag before the search term. books.py will sort them depending on the second set of tags and return a list of the book titles, author names, and years published sorted by the specified tag.

For a more powerful search, multiple search terms can be given and will be searc
hes with an AND boolean.

Given no search type, books.py will automatically search for book titles. Given no sort type, books.py will automatically sort by book title. Given multiple terms, books.py will search each one and return a combined list. books.py can also do a range if given two terms to obtain a list of books published between two different years.
